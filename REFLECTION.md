# Reflection

## What made your assistant “personal” to you?

Adding real-life tasks made my virtual assistant more personal.

## What challenges did you face using this?

One challenge was making sure my output matches the example output while meeting all the assignment requirements.

## Which method would you improve or expand?

I would improve the `completeTask` method by specifying the task to be completed instead of removing the front of the array.
